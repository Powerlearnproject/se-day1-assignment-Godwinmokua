#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
    Software Engineering is the process of designing, building, testing and maintaining software, It's importance in Tech industry is Security of the software, innovation and software accessibility

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Formal	: Ensure correctness. Models inapplicability in big problem.
2. Structured:	Personal computer. Expanding data and functional convergence
3. Object oriented	Reusing new programming approach

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning 
Involves brainstorming, defining needs, and establishing a timeline and budget
Involves analyzing the current system if applicable
2. Design
Involves outlining the application's user interfaces, system interfaces, network requirements, and databases 
Involves developing an architecture that supports the requirements 
3. Development 
Involves writing, testing, and integrating the code according to the design specifications
4. Testing 
Involves verifying the functionality of the system and ensuring that it meets the specified requirements
5. Deployment 
Involves moving the software from the testing environment to the operating environment
6. Maintenance 
Involves maintaining and updating the software to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of the end-users

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile is best for dynamic teams that frequently change members throughout the project life cycle, or for teams that assign specific team members to multiple roles. Waterfall, on the other hand, works best for established teams and where each member is given a specific role.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer (Software Engineer)

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts (textual inputs) to effectively communicate with AI models like ChatGPT, GPT-4, and other language models. The goal is to craft prompts that guide the AI to generate accurate, relevant, and high-quality responses.

It involves understanding how AI interprets input, structuring prompts logically, and experimenting with different wording to achieve the best results.

Importance of Prompt Engineering in AI Interaction:
1. Enhances AI Output Quality
Well-structured prompts lead to more precise and relevant responses.
Avoids vague, misleading, or off-topic AI-generated content.

2.Improves Efficiency & Productivity
Helps users get the desired response faster without multiple retries.
Saves time in AI-assisted tasks such as coding, content generation, and problem-solving.

3. Optimizes AI for Different Use Cases
Developers: Writing prompts for generating code, debugging, or API documentation.
Writers: Generating creative stories, blogs, or marketing copy.
Researchers: Extracting summaries, insights, or structured information from large datasets.

4. Reduces Bias & Misinterpretation
Careful wording ensures that AI does not misinterpret intent or generate biased results.
Encourages fact-based and contextually accurate responses.

5. Enables Better AI Customization
AI models can be fine-tuned with structured prompts to align with specific domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, law).
Allows for controlled tone and complexity in responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
ðŸ”¹ Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about databases."
ðŸ”¹ Improved Prompt:
"Explain the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases, including their use cases and advantages."
Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective
âœ… More Specific â€“ Instead of a broad request about "databases," it focuses on a key comparison: SQL vs. NoSQL.
âœ… Clear Intent â€“ The improved prompt explicitly asks for differences, use cases, and advantages, ensuring a well-structured response.
âœ… Concise Yet Detailed â€“ The request remains short and to the point while guiding AI toward useful, relevant information.
